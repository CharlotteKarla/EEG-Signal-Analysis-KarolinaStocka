# EEG-Signal-Analysis-KarolinaStocka
EEG-Signal-Analysis-KarolinaStocka is a Python toolkit for analyzing horse EEG signals. It provides signal preprocessing, artifact removal, spectral feature extraction (PSD, SEF95, band power), and statistical comparisons between anesthetic agents. Developed from a Master's thesis, it supports reproducible workflows for veterinary research.
